# ATM-Interface

The third and final project I worked on was an ATM interface. This project was the most challenging of the three, as it required me to develop a console-based application that emulated the functionalities of an ATM machine. I had to implement features such as displaying a menu of options, prompting the user for input, and updating account balances based on the user's actions. This project helped me develop my skills in Java programming, especially in working with classes, objects, and methods.
